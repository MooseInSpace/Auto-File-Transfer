# Auto-File-Transfer
A System Administration/Cybersecurity personal project designed to automate moving video files from my main workstation to my Network Assisted Storage (NAS) on a scheduled interval.

This is a fairly simple powershell script I wrote with the intentions of automatically moving my Valorant highlight .mp4 video files over to my NAS into a newly created folder with a name chosen by pulling the system date of my main workstation. I created this out of both a reason to learn a bit of powerscript in a useful real world scenario, as this could be used to automate the copying of backup files onto a different storage area/server.
